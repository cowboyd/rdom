libxml-ruby does not seem to have any callback for decorating nodes that are
created by libxml (e.g. while parsing a document). So, client code does not
have any opportunity to extend nodes or even use a different class.


execute <script> tags after appendChild
execute scripts appended as text nodes to <script> tags
parse styles


bugs/oddities
  
  - Error: Tag foo_bar invalid at :32.

  - libxml seems to have gc problems when it has implicitely inserted a <p>
    node while parsing text that is not wrapped into a tag (e.g. jquery tried
    to parse 'div<div>' which resulted in '<p>div</p><div/>' or similar). now
    when the parsed snippet is big enough it will get garbage collected and
    segfault
