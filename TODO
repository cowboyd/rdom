  1.6.2. Naming Exceptions
  To avoid namespace conflicts, two attributes with the same name as a keyword
  in one of our chosen binding languages were prefixed. The for attribute of the
  LABEL and SCRIPT elements collides with loop construct naming conventions and
  is renamed htmlFor. The class attribute of the HTML elements collides with
  class definitions naming conventions and is renamed className.





some of the unit tests in jquery/attributes.js and manipulation.js are 
segfaulting like crazy ... wtf
jquery/selectors.js nth-child tests run into endless loops
